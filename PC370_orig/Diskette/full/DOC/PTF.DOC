PTF.DOC private temporary fixes for PC/370

It is a violation of copyright to duplicate and distribute modified
versions of PC/370.  However, users are free to apply PTF's for their
own use on their own systems.  The following PTF's may be useful:

  1.  Change R1.2 A370.COM lines per page from 50 to some other value.

      a.  Backup A370.COM to separate disk.
      b.  Rename A370.COM TO A370.TMP
      c.  VER 0A39 C606F80332  MOV BYTE PTR [03F8],32H
      d.  VER 0A3D 32
      e.  REP 0A3D xx
      f.  Save modified file and rename.

  2.  Change R2.0A A370.EXE lines per page from 50 to some other
      value.

      a.  Backup A370.EXE to separate disk.
      b.  Rename A370.EXE TO A370.TMP
      c.  VER 0920 C6064E0532  MOV BYTE PTR [054E],32H
      d.  VER 0924 32
      e.  REP 0924 xx
      f.  Save modified file and rename.

  3.  Change R3.0 path and/or filename of E370R20.EXE generated in
      each 370 COM module by L370.EXE.  For example changing name to
      C:\E370R20.EXE allows one copy of emulator to be stored in
      root directory of hard drive.

      a.  Backup L370.EXE to separate disk.
      b.  Rename L370.EXE to L370.TMP to make debug process it as data
          file.
      c.  Start DEBUG L370.TMP
      d.  Use ENTER debug command to change 64 byte path/filename at
          offset X'342'.  Name must be followed with zero byte.
      e.  Enter W command to output modified file.
      f.  Rename L370.TMP to L370.EXE.

      Note name can also be changed in individual 370 COM module at
      X'140' if for wish to have only selected COM programs use a
      different emulator.

  4.  Note ASCII translation table has been expanded to 256 bytes in
      release 3.0 to allow special characters to be added for ASCII to
      EBCDIC and EBCDIC to ASCII translation.   This facility has been
      requested by both French and German users who have extended
      character sets.

      MODULE  TABLE   ADDRESS  EXAMPLES

      A370    EBCDIC   85D0    +X'40'=X'20' FOR EBCDIC SPACE TO ASCII
                               SPACE
      A370    ASCII    86F0    +X'20'=X'40' FOR ASCII SPACE TO EBCDIC
                               SPACE
      E370R30 EBCDIC   7AB0
      E370R30 ASCII    7C50

  5.  PTF for release 2.0A to fix blank errors in L370 due to module
      in concatenated library ending on 128 block boundary.  Low
      frequency bug in PC/370 since 1985 identified thanks to Jim Gray
      of CONVAL Software. Erroneous call was added in 1983 CP/M
      version to skip CTL-Z added to each concatenated module.

      RENAME L370.EXE L370.TMP
      DEBUG  L370.TMP
      -S 0000 FFFF 4C 54 46 E8 B9 00   (VER 2CD1 'LTF', CALL GBYTE)
      -E 2CD4 90 90 90                 (REP 2CD4 NOP,NOP,NOP - NOP
      CALL)
      -W
      RENAME L370.TMP L370.EXE

  6.  PTF for release 4.0 to prevent erroneous FQE from overlaying 8
      bytes beyond end of BIN subroutine module.  Result is
      unpredictable errors after exiting PC/370 BIN subroutine back to
      COBOL run time system.

      RENAME E370R40.EXE E370R40.TMP
      DEBUG  E370R40.TMP
      -E 55D 26.EB 89.05
      -E 56B 26.EB 88.0E
      -W
      -Q
      RENAME E370R40.TMP E370R40.EXE

  7.  PTF for release 4.2 to change resident emulator interrupt # in
      case it conflicts with interrupts installed.  Note Micro Focus
      extended memory facility XM requires that PC/370 interrupt be
      within the range hex 60-6F.  The installation default in rel.
      4.2 is hex 60 (in rel. 4.1 without XM support is was hex DC).
      To change the interrupt to 61 for example:

      a.  RENAME E370R42.EXE E370R42.TXT   change emulator
          DEBUG  E370R42.TXT
          -E 46F 60.61
          -W
          -Q
          RENAME E370R42.TXT E370R42.EXE

      b.  RENAME L370.EXE L370.TXT         change linker for COM
          DEBUG  L370.TXT                  output
          -E 307 60.61
          -W
          -Q
          RENAME L370.TXT L370.EXE

      c.  RENAME SEE.COM                   change existing COM module
          -E 107 60.61                     (after fixing L370, you can
          -W                                run BAT\BLDUTIL to fix all
          -Q                                utilities)
