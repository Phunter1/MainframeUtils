The PC/370 package is a PC shareware package which supports the
assembly, link edit, and execution of IBM 370 assembler programs
on a PC with 256k and MS-DOS release 2.0+.  See READ.ME file in
root directory for registration information.

The PC/370 package consists of four main programs:

  1.  M370.COM macro preprocessor which reads macro assembler file
      and produces expanded basic assembler source code.

  2.  A370.EXE is an IBM 370 cross assembler which reads 370 source
      code file and produces object code file plus optional listing
      file.

  3.  L370.EXE is an IBM 370 cross linkage editor which reads object
      code and produces a directly executable 370 native machine code
      file plus optional CSECT listing file.

  4.  E370R42.EXE is an IBM 370 machine code emulator which is
      dynamically invoked at execution time to support execution of
      370 native machine code including the standard problem state
      instruction set plus packed decimal and floating point
      instructions.  Direct execution of E370 makes it resident to
      eliminate the time required to dynamically load it at each 370
      program execution time, and to also support calls to 370
      subroutines from Micro Focus COBOL/2 programs running under
      the default real MS-DOS mode on any 80x86 machine or the
      extendedmemory XM protected mode on 80286 or 80386 machines.

The package also comes with several 370 assembler language utilities
including:

  1.  SEE.COM      -  full screen text editor with PFS:Write and
                      Wordstar keystroke compatibility.
  2.  PRINTDOC.COM -  format utility to print documentation with
                      page numbers.
  3.  T370.COM     -  object code translator to allow uploading 370
                      object code files for direct OS/VS linkage
                      editing on 370 mainframe without reassembly.

The PC/370 package consists of the following component directories:

  1.  R42  - root directory containing all PC/370 executable code.
  2.  DOC  - documentation ASCII text files.
  3.  BAT  - demo command procedures plus install procedure.
  4.  LIB  - 370 source code for L370.LIB system subroutine library.
  5.  CPY  - 370 source code for copy members.
  6.  MAC  - 370 source code for macros.
  7.  CBL  - 370 source code for COBOL 370 subroutine demo.
  8.  DEMO - 370 source code for demo programs.
  9.  UTIL - 370 source code for utilities SEE, PRINTDOC, and T370.

On 3.5" diskette, all of the above directories are on single disk.
On 5.25" diskettes, 3 volumes are required starting with the
R42 volume which contains BAT\INSTALL.BAT command file.

The PC/370 documentation consists for the following machine readable
files which can be printed via the utility PRINTDOC.COM:

  1.  INTRO.DOC    - overview of product.
  2.  HELP.DOC     - common questions and answers
  3.  USER.DOC     - program options required to use all of the PC/370
                     facilities at the application programmer level.
  4.  SYSTEM.DOC   - program options available for use by system
                     programmers.
  5.  MACRO.DOC    - macro preprocessor options plus included macros.
  6.  UTILITY.DOC  - utility program options.
  7.  HISTORY.DOC  - history of PC/370 releases and features
  8.  PTF.DOC      - private temporary fixes for previous releases.

The PC/370 command procedures in the \BAT directory are as follows:

  1.  INSTALL - copy all PC/370 directories to hard disk with R42
                as root and all others as sub-directories.
  2.  RUNDEMO - run all the demo programs in the \DEMO directory.
                This will verify installation and illustrate the
                PC/370 facilities.  Note last section of demo
                requires 80x87 math co-processor for floating point
                demo.  This section can be skipped if no co-processor
                is installed.
  3.  RUNUTIL - run demo of the SEE text editor, PRINTDOC print
                utility, and T370 object code format utility.
  4.  RUNMAC  - run demo of macro pre-processor facility.
  5.  RUNCBL  - run demo of Micro Focus VS COBOL 370 subroutine.
  6.  BLDLIB  - rebuild L370.LIB system relocatable subroutine
                library from source code in \LIB.
  7.  BLDUTIL - rebuild utilities from source code in \UTIL.


All of the above commands are designed assuming that the current
directory is R42 and that all of the other 8 directories are defined
in the R42 directory.  No parameters are required.

To code and execute a simple sample program, type the following after
running the installation procedure file INSTALL.BAT and setting the
current directory to \R42:

  STEP     COMMAND                  COMMENTS

    1      SEE DEMO                 invoke full screen editor to
                                    create DEMO.ALC 370 assembler
                                    source file.
    2      DEMO CSECT               first line - define section
    3           USING *,15          second     - define base register
    4           LA    2,=C'HELLO$'  third      - address of msg. text
    5           SVC   209           fourth     - request console msg.
    6           BR    14            fifth      - exit to MS-DOS
    7           END                 sixth      - end of program

    8      <esc>                    enter escape key to save DEMO.ALC
                                    and exit to MS-DOS
    9      A370 DEMO/LX             assemble DEMO.ALC and create
                                    DEMO.OBJ object code file and
                                    DEMO.PRN listing with symbol
                                    cross reference.
   10      L370 DEMO/LX             link DEMO.OBJ object file and
                                    create DEMO.COM executable file
                                    and DEMO.LST CSECT listing file.
   11      DEMO.COM                 execute DEMO.COM which will load
                                    E370R42.EXE to execute 370 machine
                                    code in DEMO.COM and print "HELLO"
                                    on the console.
   12      DEMO.COM T               execute DEMO.COM again with test
                                    parameter which invokes debug
                                    facility.
   13.     T                        At debug prompt, enter T to trace
                                    each instruction while executing
                                    the demo program.

   14.     TYPE DEMO.PRN            print assembly listing.

   15.     TYPE DEMO.LST            print link edit listing.

If you are not familiar with IBM 370 assembler language, I recommend
you obtain the text, "IBM 370 Assembler Language with ASSIST,
